The H-1B visa is the most widely used temporary work visa category in
the United States. U.S. companies use the H-1B program to employ
skilled foreign national workers in specialty occupations that require
a bachelor's degree (or higher). There is an annual numerical limit
(cap) of 65,000 new H-1Bs each fiscal year. An additional 20,000 H-1B
petitions filed on behalf of beneficiaries with a U.S. master’s degree
or higher are exempt from the regular cap. Every year, the United
States Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts an
electronic H-1B registration process and lottery to select
beneficiaries (individuals) to meet the H-1B regular cap (65,000) and
H-1B master’s cap (20,000) allotments. Any U.S. company (the
prospective employer) that submitted an H-1B registration on behalf of
the selected beneficiary is then eligible to file a corresponding H-1B
petition on behalf of that selected beneficiary.

CAP-exempt H-1B process: Some types of U.S. entities are exempt from
the H-1B numerical cap. These include institutions of higher education
or their affiliated or related nonprofit entities, nonprofit research
organizations, and government research organizations. In addition,
H-1B workers who have previously been counted against the cap are
exempt from the H-1B numerical limitations. For these cap-exempt H-1B
cases, prospective petitioners (U.S. entities) can file H-1B petitions
with USCIS without going through the annual cap H-1B registration and
lottery process.

Dependent family (spouse and child) H-4 visas and H-4 EAD: Spouses and
children (unmarried children under 21) of H-1B workers are eligible
for dependent H-4 visas. The H-4 visa category does not permit
employment in the United States. However, spouses of H-1B workers who
have an approved I-140 petition for immigrant worker are eligible for
work authorization known as the H-4 EAD.
